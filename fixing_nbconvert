Possibly caused by permission issues when downloading python versions

1. Restart VSCode and try exporting ipynb file
2. If nbconvert exists, run jupyter nbconvert <fileName>.ipynb --to html
3. pip uninstall nbconvert, pip install nbconvert, try exporting or run previous command again
   - If issue with permissions, add "sudo" before install command
